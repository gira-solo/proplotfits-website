## The Project

ProPlotFits is an open-source NCAA basketball analytics platform that combines machine learning with sports betting intelligence. We're building tools to help bettors make smarter, data-driven decisions.

**Mission:** Democratize access to high-quality sports analytics and betting insights.

**Approach:** Transparent, reproducible, continuously improving models.

**Status:** Public beta (January 2026)

## Why "ProPlotFits"?

The name combines:

- **Pro** - Professional-grade analytics
- **Plot** - Data visualization and statistical modeling  
- **Fits** - Model fitting and predictions

Plus, it sounds like "profits" 😉

## Philosophy

### Why We're Different

**1. Transparency Over Hype**

We show you exactly how our models work, what they're good at, and where they fail. No "secret sauce" or inflated win rates.

**2. Education Over Gambling**

We want you to understand sports analytics, not just blindly follow picks. Learn how to think about betting value.

**3. Long-Term Edge Over Short-Term Results**

Any model can get lucky for a few games. We focus on process and edge, not flashy win streaks.

**4. Community Over Competition**

Sports betting is not zero-sum between bettors. We're all fighting the vig, not each other. Let's share knowledge.

- We are **not** a licensed gambling service
- We do **not** accept payments for picks
- We do **not** guarantee profits
- We **strongly encourage** responsible betting
