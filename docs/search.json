No “secret sauce” or inflated win rates.\n2. Education Over Gambling\nWe want you to understand sports analytics, not just blindly follow picks. Learn how to think about betting value.\n3. Long-Term Edge Over Short-Term Results\nAny model can get lucky for a few games. We focus on process and edge, not flashy win streaks.\n4. Community Over Competition\nSports betting is not zero-sum between bettors. We’re all fighting the vig, not each other. Let’s share knowledge."

They are my favorite college athletics team.\nSolo hay uno equipo se llama los “Jayhawks”, de la Universidad de Kansas. Es mi equipo favorito de atleticas univseritarias.\nThere is only one team named the RedHawks (with the “H” capitalized like that), and that is Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. I matriculated there as a freshman three months after, and a 50 minute drive from, the Harambe incident, and graduated with a Bachelor’s and Master’s during the Covid incident. Among other things I learned Spanish and Statistics.\nSolo hay uno equipo se llama los “RedHawks” (con un “H” grande como así) de la Universidad de Miami de Ohio en Oxford. Matriculé allí como un freshman tres meses después, y cincuenta minutos de conducta desde, el incidende de Harambe, y gradué con un Bachelor’s y Master’s durante el incidente de Covid. En otras cosas, aprendí español y estadísticas.\nIt’s been five years since my only graduation (because if Harambe wasn’t enough Covid sent everybody home from just before my senior spring break). This is bilingual data journalism.\nHace cinco años que mi única graduación (porque Covid canceló las ceremonias de 2020). Por eso, bienveidos a periodísmo bilíngües de datos.\nAs of this post, Miami is for some reason undefeated and Kansas is a top-10 team with six losses. Kansas must have a lot of legacy fans, whereas CBS Sports’ Bracketology shows no other MAC school getting invited to the tournament.\nA partir de hoy, Miami tiene ninguna derrota y Kansas está dentro el Top 10 con séis derrotas. Es cierto que Kansas tiene muchísimos fanaticos antiguos. Miami es la\nI never once attended a football or basketball game at Miami (I did see one hockey game). I like sports, but no one I went to school with was a fanatic about any sport. Apparently the RedHawks used to be super good at hockey and have accomplished alumni in the NHL, but by 2016 that hype seemed to have faded. To see Miami ranked 23 and not in football or hockey is quite astonishing, and it seems that Millett Hall is the place to be on game day despite being slated for demolition.\nNot that the facility holds any sentimental value to me or anything, but rather the plans to replace Millett do worry me. My urban planning professor Dr. David Prytherch outlined the cost of developing a “Arena District” (which includes ) on top of an area that currently exists as a multi-use collection of turf fields known as “Cook Field”.\nI for sure hope Miami doesn’t use this new hype to justify building an arena and hotel right in the middle of campus. I could go on about how, from a transportation point of view, it’s down right absurd. But you’re here for predictive sports analytics, not expected transportation blunders.\nCheck-out a hypothetical match-up between the Jayhawks and RedHawks here."

    "text": "What We’re Looking For\nIf the goal is to use data to bet responsible AND share our results in reproducible manner, we need to isolate the data that helps us develop a model that predicts winners in potential match-ups.\nDean Oliver narrowed the most important analytics of college basketball down to Four Factors:\n\nShooting Efficiency - More baskets and fewer misses\nTurnovers - Number of times losing a possession\nRebounds - Number of times gaining a possession\nFree Throws - Free points\n\nAdditionally, there are efficiency ratings - points scored and allowed per 100 possessions - which help adjust for pace.\nWhen we talk about using machine learning to help us predict the outcome of match-ups, what we are actually doing is identifying features of a phenomena that could potentially assist us in determining outcomes. That is incredibly boiled down, but when we develop these predictive models, the models themselves let the analysts know what features are driving most of the explanation."

    "text": "Interpreting the Results\nWin Probability: Based on recent form and match-up metrics, the model estimates likelihood of home team success. Given that my model tends to default to the home-team winning, this one is quite a shocker.\nScore Differential: The expected margin. Positive means home team favored, negative means away team favored.\nTotal Score: The expected combined output from both teams. Influenced by pace and efficiency.\nTake-away: I’m very surprised that, even when displaying results that are well within our established margin-of-error, we are seeing compelling evidence that a hypothetical game between Miami and Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence is essentially a toss-up/leans Miami.\nThe reason I say toss up is because the of the result of the margin model (expected score differential). That model showed an MAE of 10.55. I would not count on Miami actually beating the Jayhawks unless the prediction for the match-up resulted in a value of, say, -11. In which case, yeah I’d declare that I’m picking Miami."

    "text": "There is only one team named the Jayhawks and that is the University of Kansas. They are my favorite college athletics team.\nThere is only one team named the RedHawks (with the “H” capitalized like that), and that is Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. I matriculated there as a freshman three months after, and a 50 minute drive from, the Harambe incident, and graduated with a Bachelor’s and Master’s during the Covid incident. Among other things I learned Spanish and Statistics.\nIt’s been five years since my only graduation (because if Harambe wasn’t enough Covid sent everybody home from just before my senior spring break). This is bilingual data journalism.\nAs of this post, Miami is for some reason undefeated and Kansas is a top-10 team with six losses. Kansas must have a lot of legacy fans, whereas CBS Sports’ Bracketology shows no other MAC school getting invited to the tournament.\nI never once attended a football or basketball game at Miami (I did see one hockey game). I like sports, but no one I went to school with was fanatic about any sport. Apparently the RedHawks used to be super good at hockey and have accomplished alumni in the NHL, but by 2016 that hype seemed to have faded. To see Miami ranked 23 and not in football or hockey is quite astonishing, and it seems that Millett Hall is the place to be on game day despite being slated for demolition.\nNot that the facility holds any sentimental value to me or anything, but rather the plans to replace Millett do worry me. My urban planning professor Dr. David Prytherch outlined the cost of developing a “Arena District” (which includes ) on top of an area that currently exists as a multi-use collection of turf fields known as “Cook Field”.\nI for sure hope Miami doesn’t use this new hype to justify building an arena and hotel right in the middle of campus. I could go on about how, from a transportation point of view, it’s down right absurd. But you’re here for predictive sports analytics, not expected transportation blunders.\nCheck-out a hypothetical match-up between the Jayhawks and RedHawks here."

That is incredibly boiled down, but when we develop these predictive models, the models themselves let the analysts know what features are driving most of the explanation."

Positive means home team favored, negative means away team favored.\nTotal Score: The expected combined output from both teams. Influenced by pace and efficiency.\nTake-away: I’m very surprised that, even when displaying results that are well within our established margin-of-error, we are seeing compelling evidence that a hypothetical game between Miami and Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence is essentially a toss-up/leans Miami.\nThe reason I say toss up is because the of the result of the margin model (expected score differential). That model showed an MAE of 10.55. I would not count on Miami actually beating the Jayhawks unless the prediction for the match-up resulted in a value of, say, -11. In which case, yeah I’d declare that I’m picking Miami."

When say “Clemson by 0.3” we’re actually saying “In the midst of intense noise, there is the tiniest bit of signal indicating that Clemson will win but just barely”.

    "text": "Comparing to DraftKings\nLet’s look at the odds that DraftKings gives for this match-up and compare to our models.\n\n\nCode\nvegas_comparison &lt;- tibble(\n  Metric = c(\"Spread\", \"Total\"),\n  `Our Model` = c(\"Clem -0.3\", \"139.5\"),\n  Vegas = c(\"Clem -8.5\", \"143.5\"),\n  Gap = c(\"8.2 points\", \"4 points\"),\n  `% of MAE` = c(\"86.3%\", \"29.6%\"),\n  Confidence = c(\"Very High\", \"Low\")\n)\n\nvegas_comparison |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_caption(\"DraftKings Lines vs Model Outputs\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  DraftKings Lines vs Model Outputs\n  \n    \n      Metric\n      Our Model\n      Vegas\n      Gap\n      % of MAE\n      Confidence\n    \n  \n  \n    Spread\nClem -0.3\nClem -8.5\n8.2 points\n86.3%\nVery High\n    Total\n139.5\n143.5\n4 points\n29.6%\nLow\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nEdge Analysis\nBefore I go into what this table is showing, let’s breakdown how I’d classify the confidence of my edges (comparing the difference between Vegas and our model with our model MAE).\n\nElite (&gt;100% of MAE): Highest conviction but doesn’t happen that often. This shows that Vegas is way off\nVery High (80%-100%): Don’t miss these high premium picks\nHigh (60%-80%): Strong and worth betting\nModerate (40%-60%): Definitely the place to incorporate additional information\nLow (20%-40%): Maybe there is value, but it’s definitely not premium\nNoise (0%-20%): Model and Vegas agree, so we ignore\n\nNow here’s how our match-up stacks against DraftKings.\nTotals: The difference between our model and Vegas is 4 points, which is less than 30% of our MAE. It is an edge, but not that great. I’d personally skip.\nSpread: Now we got something interesting. Our model is showing that these two teams are dead even, and it even predicts that Clemson will win by less than a point. DraftKings thinks Clemson will win by at least 9, and all indications from our analysis conclude that that margin is unlikely to happen. I will definitely take this one."

    "section": "The Picks",
    "text": "The Picks\nTotal: Take the UNDER\nAccording to each team’s pace, this game should average 65.3 possessions, and at 1.07 points per possession (average for college basketball), that’s 65.3*1.07*2 = 139.7 projected total just based on raw stats. As I said, I think I will pass.\nSpread: Take Florida St +8.5\nI just don’t see how Clemson has enough skill to beat a scrappy FSU squad by 9 points. FSU beats them in head-to-head stats match-up except for offensive rebounding."

    "text": "Conclusion\nI hope you enjoyed this breakdown. This is a drawn-out version of what I’m doing to discover edges analytically, but I wanted to show y’all how to think statistically and probabilistically rather than just going with gut feeling.\nData-driven betting looks like this. We “run the numbers”, then take a second to sit back and engage with the information before going of and placing bets. And I’m showing you my work, which is the difference between guessing and analysis.\n\nWant to see these predictions daily with full model outputs and edge analysis?
