No “secret sauce” or inflated win rates.\n2. Education Over Gambling\nWe want you to understand sports analytics, not just blindly follow picks. Learn how to think about betting value.\n3. Long-Term Edge Over Short-Term Results\nAny model can get lucky for a few games. We focus on process and edge, not flashy win streaks.\n4. Community Over Competition\nSports betting is not zero-sum between bettors. We’re all fighting the vig, not each other. Let’s share knowledge."
